## self_driving_corvette

### Details:
_Arduino project for a self driving car_

* Written in C/C++
* Used an Elegoo Uno R3


### Purpose:
* __The objective was to create a self-driving car with the sensors available in the Elegoo Uno R3 Starter Kit (knock-off Arduino Uno) and a cheap toy car from Marshals__ 
* Detect an obstacle at least one inch away and change position of tires before moving
* Correct tire position until the car can proceed without an obstacle
* _the ultimate goal was to learn how to code and have fun!_
